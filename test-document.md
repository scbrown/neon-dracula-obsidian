# Neon Dracula Theme Showcase

## Headers Glow Golden Orange

### With Black Outline for Readability

#### All Header Levels Have the Effect

##### Even the Smaller Ones

###### Down to H6

## Text Styling

Here is some **bold text with orange glow** and *italic text with green glow*.

Links like [[internal link]] and [external links](https://example.com) have orange neon glow.

Tags are neon green: #example #neon #dracula #cyberpunk

## Inline Code

Use `inline code` for commands like `npm install` or variables like `$neonColor`.

The green glow makes code pop against the dark background.
